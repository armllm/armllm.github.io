_Last updated: February 18, 2026_

Welcome! We know you have questions about how the summer school works. We have compiled this Q&A based on previous years to help you out. If your question is not answered here, feel free to reach out!

### 🧭 1) Program Overview

**When and where is the summer school happening?** The 2026 school is scheduled for **August 3-7, 2026** at the **AI9 Startup Campus** (9 Isahakyan St, Yerevan, Armenia).

**Is there an online option?** Yes! We offer an online track via Zoom. This covers all the theoretical sessions. However, please note that online participants typically do not get access to GPU resources.

**Will there be a hackathon?** Yes. The hackathon will start on **August 8 at 00:00** and run for a full **24-hour hack day**. It will be organized by our partner **AI9**. Armenia LLM Summer School will act as a **content partner** for the hackathon.

**What should I bring?** A **laptop** is a must-have! All the hands-on and practical sessions require you to have your own machine.

**Do I need a powerful computer?** If you are attending in person, we provide the **GPU resources** for the heavy lifting. You just need a reliable laptop to connect and code. Online participants generally do not have access to these shared GPU resources.

**Do you provide housing or food?** We do not provide accommodation directly, but we usually recommend the **Yerevan State University guesthouse**. It is affordable (~35 USD/day in 2025) and within walking distance. For food, we provide coffee and snacks during breaks, but you will need to handle your own lunch and dinner at the many great cafes nearby.

**What are some good cafes within 5 minutes of the campus?** Yerevan has a vibrant coffee culture. Here are some great spots just a few minutes away: **To add**

**How do we stay updated during the school?** Once you are confirmed, you will get an invite to our **Slack channel**. This is where we post the agenda, links, and where you can chat with instructors and other students.

### ✅ 2) Eligibility & Technical Background

**Who should apply?** The program is designed for motivated learners in AI, including students, researchers, and engineers. If you are interested in LLMs and can follow technical sessions, you are encouraged to apply.

**Do I need prior LLM experience?** No. Prior hands-on LLM experience is not required. However, applicants are expected to have a foundational understanding of machine learning and neural networks.

**Do I need Python experience?** Python proficiency is expected and is explicitly asked in the form. Applicants are asked to self-report their level (e.g., excellent, somewhat proficient, or not proficient).

### 📝 3) Application & Selection

**How are applicants selected?** Selection is competitive and follows a two-stage process: (1) initial form application and (2) technical assessment. Final confirmations are sent after evaluating both the application and the test results.

**What information do I need for registration?** The form asks for personal/contact details, location, academic/industry affiliation, experience with ML and LLMs, Python proficiency, and a motivation paragraph (~100 words). You may also provide links such as GitHub and Google Scholar.

**What files do I need to upload?** You must upload your CV/resume (1 file, up to 10 MB).

**What is the application timeline for 2026?**
- **Stage 1 (Initial application):** submit the form and CV by **May 15, 2026**.
- **Stage 2 (Technical assessment):** applicants should monitor email for a test link on **June 10** (after the application phase closes on June 1).
- **Final step:** successful candidates receive confirmation by email.

**What if I do not receive the technical test link?** Contact the organizers at **armeniallm@gmail.com**.

**Is there a waitlist?** Since capacity is limited and selection is competitive, applicants may not all be admitted. If in-person spots open, we may contact waitlisted applicants; in some cases, online participation may be offered.

- **International/Exceptional Applicants:** If we have the budget, we sometimes offer waivers (from 50% to full scholarships) to non-student applicants with exceptional backgrounds.

**Can I apply for financial aid during registration?** Yes. The form includes a direct question asking whether you are applying for financial aid.

**How do I pay if I am an international applicant?** International bank transfers. If those do not work for you, let us know if you are stuck.
